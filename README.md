# Tired of the Same Old Helper Classes?  

Jintonic is the **first Android library fully based on AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**. It allows you to **hook and weave behavior at build time** directly into your `.class` files via Gradle plugins.

## Features

- **Easy-to-use annotations** for common checks and behaviors:
```kotlin
@RequireInternet(mustThrow = true)
@MinBattery(minOrEqualValue = 60)
fun kotlinApiCall() = "Kotlin Api call done successfully"

@Timed
fun hello() = runBlocking {
    delay(5000)
}

@RequireVpn
fun vpnMethod() {
    LOG("Executed Vpn Method")
}

@WithRoot(forRoot = false)
fun rootMethod() {
    LOG("Inside root method")
}
````

* **Hook and intercept methods** with zero boilerplate
* **Build-time weaving** for optimized performance
* **Full control over cross-cutting concerns** like logging, validation, and execution policies
