<p style="font-size:18px; text-align:center;">
  <b>Jintonic</b> is the <b>first Android library fully based on AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)</b>.<br/><br>
  It allows you to <b>hook and weave behaviors at build time</b> directly into your <code>.class</code> files through Gradle plugins.
</p>

## ‚ú® Features

- **Easy-to-use annotations** for checks and safety:

```kotlin
@RequireInternet(mustThrow = true)
@MinBattery(minOrEqualValue = 60)
fun kotlinApiCall() = "Kotlin Api call done successfully"

@Timed
fun hello() = runBlocking {
    delay(5000)
}

@RequireVpn
fun vpnMethod() {
    LOG("Executed Vpn Method")
}

@WithRoot(forRoot = false)
fun rootMethod() {
    LOG("Inside root method")
}
```

- ‚úÖ Hook and intercept methods with zero boilerplate
- ‚ö° Build-time weaving for optimized performance
- üîß Full control over **cross-cutting concerns** like logging, validation, and execution policies

## üöÄ Getting Started

Add Jintonic to your project:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.crescenzi.jintonic.gradle") version "X.Y.Z"
}

dependencies {
    implementation(":com.crescenzi.jintonic:vX.Y.Z")
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What I Have to Know

- Not all annotations require Android permissions.
- Some checks (like `@RequireInternet` or `@RequireVpn`) may need specific permissions, while others don‚Äôt.
- üëâ Before using any annotation, **read its source code** in the repository to understand exactly which permissions (if any) are required.
